# Diabetes-Prediction-Project
Machine Learning model for predicting diabetes based on dataset analysis.
# Diabetes Prediction Project
This project is focused on using machine learning techniques to predict diabetes based on a given dataset. The dataset includes various health indicators that help predict whether an individual is likely to develop diabetes.

# Project Overview
The primary goal is to explore, clean, and analyze the data, and then apply machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model. The project uses Python and popular libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook for the analysis.

# Notebooks
**Diabetes_Dataset_.ipynb:** Contains the code for data exploration, preprocessing, and model building.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains features like age, BMI, blood pressure, insulin levels, and more. Each row in the dataset represents a patient's health metrics.

# Model
We experimented with several models, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
